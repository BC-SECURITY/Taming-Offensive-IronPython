# Taming-Offensive-IronPython
IronPython is a powerful and flexible programming language that has been increasingly used by attackers due to its ability to bypass security controls. This practical workshop will explore the inner workings of IronPython and its unique features that enable sophisticated offensive techniques. Participants will gain hands-on experience in developing IronPython payloads that can evade modern security controls and execute malicious code on target systems.

The workshop will cover the following topics:
1. Introduction to IronPython: Basic syntax and usage of IronPython, and how it can be used in offensive scenarios.
2. BYOI and DLR: Bring Your Own Interpreter (BYOI) and Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) concepts and their role in developing offensive payloads.
3. Malware Development with IronPython: Develop sophisticated payloads that can bypass modern security controls and execute malicious code on target systems.
4. Anti-Forensics and Evasion Techniques: Techniques to make the payloads more resilient to forensic analysis and detection.
5. Advanced Techniques: Advanced techniques like using IronPython with C# and PowerShell and integrating the payloads with other offensive tools.

This workshop is designed for offensive security professionals, red teamers, penetration testers, and anyone interested in exploring the capabilities of IronPython for offensive purposes. Participants should have a basic understanding of Python and programming concepts. By the end of the workshop, participants will have a deeper understanding of IronPython and its capabilities for developing offensive payloads.
